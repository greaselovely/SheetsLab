I've been working on a Google Sheets project called "SheetsLab" that showcases various advanced capabilities of Google Sheets. It's organized with multiple .gs files and HTML templates.

Project parameters:
1. The code will be posted on GitHub as an open-source knowledge base.
2. The code needs to automatically create all required sheets when users first run it.
3. Code is organized into multiple .gs files, keeping functionality specific to each file.
4. Each file has the filename as a comment at the top.
5. HTML files use Bootstrap instead of custom CSS.
6. One file should be created at a time to ensure quality and proper review.

The main components of SheetsLab include:
- Config.gs - Configuration settings and constants
- Setup.gs - Sheet creation and initialization
- Menu.gs - Custom menu creation and handling
- UI.gs - UI elements like sidebars and modals
- DataTools.gs - Data handling utilities
- Visualization.gs - Chart and dashboard helpers
- Integration.gs - External API connections
- FormulaExamples.gs - Advanced formula demonstrations
- Utilities.gs - General utility functions

HTML files include:
- NavigationSidebar.html - For the navigation sidebar (using Bootstrap)
- AdvancedFormDialog.html - For the advanced form UI (using Bootstrap)
- ProgressDemo.html - For progress indicator demo (using Bootstrap)
- ApiConnectionDialog.html - For API connections (using Bootstrap)
- DataImportDialog.html - For data import options (using Bootstrap)
- EmailAutomationDialog.html - For email automation demo (using Bootstrap)

The project demonstrates features like:
1. Custom UI elements (sidebars, modals, custom menus)
2. Data handling (validation, filtering, transformations)
3. Data visualization and dashboards
4. Integration with external services and APIs
5. Advanced formula techniques
6. Utility functions and custom functions

When continuing this project, please remember:
1. Create and update one file at a time, waiting for confirmation before moving to the next
2. Add the filename as a comment at the top of each file
3. Use Bootstrap for all HTML files
4. Keep code modular and well-documented

I'd like to continue working on this project. Can you help me with the next steps or enhancements?
